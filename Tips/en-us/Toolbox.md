# About Toolbox

The toolbox contains some solutions to Office problems, based on users' feedback and actual experience. So if you have some unresolved Office issues, try the toolbox.

`Note: We've never guaranteed that we can solve the problem. In some cases, you may need to reinstall the system to resolve the issue.`

## Force Remove Office

---

**Do NOT use this feature if you can uninstall Office properly.** Office should be forced to be removed with built-in tools/scripts only if it cannot be uninstalled properly. The scripts/tools we use are collected from the official Microsoft website, please feel free to use.

`Suggestion: Do NOT perform other operations during the execution.`

## Convert Documents

---

This feature requires the latest version of Office to be installed on your computer, or this feature may not work properly.

The principle of this function is to perform open, save as, and close operations instead of you. That's why Office Tool Plus can't process other messages. If some dialog boxes appear during the conversion process, please handle them manually, otherwise the conversion will not continue. `We recommend setting some tips to Don't Remind Again.`

Note: This feature may not have a high conversion rate for some special reasons.
