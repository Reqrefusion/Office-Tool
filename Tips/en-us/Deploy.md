# About Deployment

Here you can manage the currently installed Office products and language packs. If you don't have Office installed, you can do a fresh install.

You can query the version number and the release date on each channel in Version Information. After that, you can specify the version at the time of download or installation. If it's not specified, the latest version will be specified by default.

**Note: Office can only be installed on your system disk. This is determined by Microsoft.**

## Installation Module

---

Office Deployment Tool is a Microsoft official tool for deploying Office, and Office Tool Plus supports almost all of its parameter settings.
Office Tool Plus Module is a small module that we developed to install Office. Its functionality is not as powerful as the Office Deployment Tool, but it also allows Office to be installed smoothly.

[Configuration options for the Office Deployment Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/configuration-options-for-the-office-2016-deployment-tool)

**If you want to install Office 2019 Volume in Windows 7, please change module to Office Tool Plus!**

`Note: When you have problems installing with the Office Deployment Tool, try the Office Tool Plus module!`

## Channel Setting

---

`Office, Visio, Project 2019 [Volume] only support the Office 2019 Perpetual Enterprise Channel, and can't be mixed with other products (Like Office 365).`
If you want to install Visio while you have Office 365 installed, choose Visio 2016 Retail/Volume or Visio 2019 Retail (Project is the same).

Office 2016/2019 [Retail]/365 can choose other channels (Except Office 2019 Perpetual Enterprise Channel). We recommend using Monthly Channel, and office workers who don't care about new features can choose Semi-Annual Channel. **If you are experiencing problems with Targeted/Insider/Dogfood Channel, please resolve them yourself.**

## Fresh Install

---

Before start, we recommend reading the Channel Setting section first.

Click [+ Add product] button and select what you want. For Office/Visio, you can uncheck unwanted apps **(Groove means OneDrive for Business, Lync means Skype for Business)**.

Click [+ Add language pack] button and select your language. If you didn't specify a language pack, Office Tool Plus will match the system language by default (If it can't be adapted, [en-us] - English (US) will be installed as the main language).

Then click [Deploy Office] button to start.

`Note: If you manually added language packs, please add at least one language pack of type [Full].`

## Add Or Remove Products/Language Packs

If Office is already installed on your computer, you can add or remove products/language packs through Office Tool Plus.

### Add Products/Language Packs

Just click [+ Add product]/[+ Add language pack] button and select what you want. 

`Note: To avoid problems, do NOT add an installed product/language pack.`

## Installation Files

---

The installation files is the installation package for Office. Office Tool Plus can download Office installation files from Microsoft servers and make ISO images. After downloading the installation files, you can use offline installation or share them to others to save bandwidth or reduce time.

The channel determines what version of the office you can install, so we recommend reading the Channel Setting section first.

Click the submenu "Download installation files" of Installation Files Manage to start. You can set it up yourself or use the Office Tool Plus default settings, then click [Start] button to download.
